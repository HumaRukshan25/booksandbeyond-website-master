<h3 align=left>
Madman, tyrant, animal- history has given Adolf Hitler many names.<br>
 In Mein Kampf (My Struggle), often called the Nazi bible, Hitler describes his life,<br>
  frustrations, ideals, and dreams. Born to an impoverished couple in a small town in Austria,<br>
   the young Adolf grew up with the fervent desire to become a painter.<br>
    The death of his parents and outright rejection from art schools in Vienna<br>
     forced him into underpaid work as a labourer. <br><br>
     During the First World War, Hitler served in the infantry and was decorated for bravery.<br>
      After the war, he became actively involved with socialist political groups<br>
       and quickly rose to power, establishing himself as Chairman of the National Socialist German Worker's party.<br>
       In 1924, Hitler led a coalition of nationalist groups in a bid to overthrow the Bavarian government<br>
        in Munich. The infamous Munich "Beer-hall putsch" was unsuccessful, and Hitler was arrested.<br>
         During the nine months he was in prison, an embittered and frustrated Hitler dictated<br>
          a personal manifesto to his loyal follower Rudolph Hess. He vented his sentiments against<br>
           communism and the Jewish people in this document, which was to become Mein Kampf,<br>
            the controversial book that is seen as the blue-print for Hitler's political and military campaign.<br>
            <br>
             In Mein Kampf, Hitler describes his strategy for rebuilding Germany and conquering Europe.<br>
              It is a glimpse into the mind of a man who destabilized world peace and pursued the genocide now known as the Holocaust.<br><br>
               "... I believe today that my conduct is in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator. <br>In standing guard against the Jew I am defending the handiwork of the Lord" <br><br>
