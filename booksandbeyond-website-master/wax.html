Poppy hightails it home,<br> only to be shocked when one of the figures a teenage boy<br> who doesn't seem to know what he is jumps naked and screaming out of the trunk<br> of her car. She tries to return him to the candle factory,<br> but before she can, a fire destroys the mysterious workshop<br>and the old woman is nowhere to be seen.<br>

With the help of the wax boy, who answers to the name Dud, Poppy resolves<br> to find out who was behind the fire. But in the course of her investigation,<br> she discovers that things in Paraffin aren't always as they seem,<br> that the Grosholtz Candle Factory isn't as pure as its reputation<br>and that some of the towns people she's known her entire life<br> may not be as human as they once were. In fact, they're starting<br> to look a little . . . waxy.<br> Can Poppy and Dud extinguish the evil that's taking hold of their town before it's too late?<br>
