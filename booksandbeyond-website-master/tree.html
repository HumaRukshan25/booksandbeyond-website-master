World War I battlefield nurse Bess Crawford goes to dangerous lengths to investigate<br> a wounded soldier's background and uncover his true loyalties<br>in this thrilling and atmospheric entry in the bestselling<br>"vivid period mystery series" (New York Times Book Review).<br>

At the foot of a tree shattered by shelling and gunfire,<br> stretcher-bearers find an exhausted officer, shivering with cold and a loss of blood<br> from several wounds. The soldier is brought to battlefield nurse Bess Crawford's aid station,<br> where she stabilizes him and treats his injuries before he is sent<br> to a rear hospital. The odd thing is, the officer isn't British--he's French. <br>But in a moment of anger and stress, he shouts at Bess in German.<br> 

When Bess reports the incident to Matron, her superior offers a ready explanation.<br> The soldier is from Alsace-Lorraine, a province in the west<br> where the tenuous border between France and Germany has continually shifted through history,<br> most recently in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, won by the Germans.<br> But is the wounded man Alsatian?<br><br> And if he is, on which side of the war do his sympathies really lie?<br>

Of course, Matron could be right, but Bess remains uneasy—and unconvinced.<br> If he were a French soldier, what was he doing so far from his own lines . . .<br> and so close to where the Germans are putting up a fierce, last-ditch fight?<br><br> 

When the French officer disappears in Paris, it's up to <br>Bess—a soldier's daughter as well as a nurse—<br>to find out why, even at the risk of her own life. <br><br>
